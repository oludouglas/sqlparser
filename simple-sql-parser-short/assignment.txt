Simple SQL Parser
-------------------

Develop a handwritten parser that is able to parse SQL commands defined in the "operations.sql" into a simple 
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It does not have to support all features that 
are available in SQL but only the ones used by the example SQL file.

Use one of the following programming languages for the task: C#, Java, Go, 
or TypeScript/JavaScript. You can upload the result on GitHub or simply send us an archive with the source code.
